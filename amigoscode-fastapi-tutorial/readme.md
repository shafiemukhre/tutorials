### learnings

- `pip install fastapi "uvicorn[standard]"`

- `uvicorn main:app --reload` to launch [main.py](http://main.py) file

- got to https://localhost:8000/docs and you can interactive API docs built in for your api endpoints - this is nice. You can use this instead of Thunder Client or postman to test your api.

- http://localhost:8000/redoc for just API documentation, itâ€™s not interactive. also clean and nice.

- `pipreqs` after development to generate the requirements.txt file
